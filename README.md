# supply_chain_analytics


PROOF OF CONCEPT

The data:
- The data is randomly generated.
- The map locations do not correspond to actual plant or customer coordinates.


Designed to optimize operations and enhance decision-making through a dynamic dashboard built. It provides a modular solution for optimizing supply chain networks by minimizing total costs while considering supply, demand, and transportation constraints. Users can adjust parameters like cities, plants, and operational costs, enabling custom "What If" scenarios such as cost adjustments and demand changes. The app features interactive visualizations, summary statistics, and an optimized network map, offering valuable insights for both basic and advanced users.
